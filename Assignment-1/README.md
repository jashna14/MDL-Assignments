# Machine Data and Learning Assignment #1

## Question Statement


## Calculating Bias and Variance
In this question you are going to calculate the bias and variance of your trained
model.

### How to Re-sample data
You have been provided a dataset consisting of pairs (x i , y i ). It can be loaded
into your python program using <b>pickle.load()</b> function. Split the dataset into
training and testing(90:10 split). Now divides the train set into 10 equal parts
randomly, so that you will get 10 different dataset to train your model.

### Task
After re-sampling data, you have 11 different datasets ( 10 train sets and 1 test
set). Train a linear classifier on each of the 10 train set separately, so that you
have 10 different classifiers or models. You have 10 different models or classifiers
trained separately on 10 different training set, so now you can calculate the bias
and variance. You need to repeat the above process for the following class of
functions.
* y = mx
* y = ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c
* y = ax<sup>4</sup> + bx<sup>3</sup> + cx<sup>2</sup> + dx + e
And so on up till polynomial of degree 9. You are only supposed to use
sklearnâ€™s <b>linear_model.LinearRegression().fit()</b> for finding the appro-
priate coefficients with the default parameters. Tabulate the values of
bias and variance and also write a detailed report explaining how bias and
variance changes as you vary your function classes.


## Bias-Variance

### Task: 
You have been provided with a training data and a testing data. You
need to fit the given data to polynomials of degree 1 to 9(both inclusive). You
are only supposed to use sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression().fit() with the
default parameters to fit the model to your data. You might need to play around
with the data for this. Check out <b>sklearn.preprocessing.PolynomialFeatures</b>.
Specifically, you have been given 20 subsets of training data containing 400
samples each. For each polynomial, create 20 models trained on the 20 different
subsets and find the variance of the predictions on the testing data. Also, find
the bias of your trained models on the testing data. Finally plot the bias-variance
trade-Off graph. Note: You do not need to plot the curve for total error. The
formula for bias and variance are for a single input but as the testing data
contains more than one input, take the mean wherever required. Write your
observations in the report with respect to underfitting, overfitting and also
comment on the type of data just by looking at the bias-variance plot.
